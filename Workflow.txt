** Copy missing textures **
Texture "maywall" should exist in \EQExports\fearplane\Zone, but doesn't.  It's in the materiallist.  It's in the \Objects\  Copy this manually

(To do this, uncheck "Has Header Row?" and select "Update Existing" on the CSV settings pop-up on import)

** Package everything up
Copy all of the output files from EQWOWConverter and the DBC changes into a MPQ and deploy
Important: Make sure the max file count inside the MPQ is set to something quite large (65536) preferrably
- In Ladik's MPQ Editor, Operations > Set Max File Count

Run the scripts located into the exports directory subfolder \AzerothCoreSQLScripts\
