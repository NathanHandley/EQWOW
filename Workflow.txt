** Extracting Everquest Assets **
Use LaternExtractor
- Edit 'settings.txt' inside the respective Release/Debug binary folder
 - Set the Everquest directory
 - Set ModelExportFormat = 0 (Intermediate)
 - Set ExportHiddenGeometry = true
 - Set ExportZoneWithObjects = true
 - Set ExportCharacterToSingleFolder = true
 - Set ExportEquipmentToSingleFolder = true
 - Set ExportSoundsToSingleFolder = true
 - Set CopyMusic = true
- Execute LaternExtractor.exe
 - Enter command "all", push enter
 
** Condition the EQ objects **
Use EQWOWConverter
- Run command "Condition Exported EQ Data"
 
** Converting EQ texture assets into BLP **
Use BLPNG Converter
- To BLP > Choose Folder  (select the conditioned assets folder)

** Copy missing textures **
Texture "maywall" should exist in \EQExports\fearplane\Zone, but doesn't.  It's in the materiallist.  It's in the \Objects\  Copy this manually
Texture "canwall1" should exist in \EQExports\oasis\Zone, but doesn't.  It's in the materiallist.  It's in the \Objects\  Copy this manually
Texture "kruphse3" should exist in \EQExports\swampofnohope\Zone, but doesn't.  It's in the materiallist.  It's in the \Objects\  Copy this manually

** Converting Everquest Map Assets (as obj) into World of Warcraft 3.3.5 assets (wmo) **
Use EQWOWConverter
- Run command "Convert zones to WMO"

** Update related DBC files
Use WDBX Editor
Go into the exports directory, and import the csv script files in \DBCUpdateScripts\.  Replace any values that exist, and there is no header row
(To do this, uncheck "Has Header Row?" and select "Update Existing" on the CSV settings pop-up on import)

** Package everything up
Copy all of the output files from EQWOWConverter and the DBC changes into a MPQ and deploy

** Create the tele position
Example:
DELETE FROM game_tele WHERE id = 1492;
INSERT INTO `game_tele` (`id`, `position_x`, `position_y`, `position_z`, `orientation`, `map`, `name`) VALUES (1492, 10, 10, 10, 0.5, 725, 'EQArena');

** Create instance_template record
Example:
DELETE FROM `instance_template` WHERE map = 725;
INSERT INTO `instance_template` (`map`, `parent`, `script`, `allowMount`) VALUES (725, 0, '', 0);

** Important **
Make sure the max file count inside the MPQ is set to something quite large (65536) preferrably
