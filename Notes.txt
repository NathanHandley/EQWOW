** Versions **
- Everquest Trilogy (note: COULD use Titanium, but would need to parse down list of assets)
- World of Warcraft WOTLK v3.3.5a (original, not classic re-release)

** TODO **
- Chunks use little-endian style byte order.  Make sure the chunk identifier is in the right order!
- Add source for LaternExtractor
- Respective Updates in WMOAreaTable.dbc and AreaTable.dbc  NOTE: Reserving WMOID range 7000 - 8000, AreaTable.ID range 6000-7000, AreaBit 3800+
- Respective Updates in WMOAreaTable.dbc related to WMOGRoupID.  Range will be 30000-40000
- Respective Updates in Map.dbc and MapDifficulty.dbc.  Range will be 750+
- Make changes to SQL table game_tele
- Need alternate solution for animated textures on map files (perhaps move to M2?)

** Folder Structure **
Maps:
	wmo: World\wmo\Everquest\<zone>.wmo
	wdt: World\Maps\EQ_<zone>\EQ_<zone>.wdt
	wdl: World\Maps\EQ_<zone>\EQ_<zone>.wdl
	textures: World\Everquest\ZoneTextures\<zone>\<texture>.blp
Objects (contain M2 and textures):
	World\Everquest\PassiveDoodads\
	World\Everquest\ActiveDoodads\
	....
Notes:
	wdt/wdl file names need to match the folder name exactly
	
** Issues
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Texture "maywall" should exist in \EQExports\fearplane\Zone, but doesn't.  It's in the material.  It's in the \Objects\
Texture "canwall1" should exist in \EQExports\oasis\Zone, but doesn't.  It's in the materiallist.  It's in the \Objects\  Copy this manually
Texture "kruphse3" should exist in \EQExports\swampofnohope\Zone, but doesn't.  It's in the materiallist.  It's in the \Objects\  Copy this manually

Test Skyfire, I had to break it up
- Doesn't look good
- Also timmourous
Mistmoore missing a lot of textures...
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


** Breakup notes
Comb mesh for indicies that share a material, and group by that
	
** Coordinate and Space **
- Everquest: X-Axis is S(neg) to N(pos), Y-Axis is E(neg) to W(pos)
- WoW: X-Axis is N(pos) to S(neg), Y-Axis is W(pos), to E(neg).  Z is up(pos) and down (neg)
- WoW maps are divided into 64x64 blocks (total of 4096) and each block is divided into 16x16 chunks.
- WoW map blocks are 533.33333 yards (1600 feet) w x height.  Coordinate origin is center, so +/- 17066.66656
- Each map chunk is 33.3333 yards (100 feet)
- In EQ, 1 unit of space is about 1 foot
- In WoW, 1 unit of space is about 1 meter (3.28 feet)
- Everquest maps to be broken up into 1000 x 1000 unit sub areas
