** Extracting Everquest Assets **
Use LaternExtractor
- Edit 'settings.txt' inside the respective Release/Debug binary folder
 - Set the Everquest directory
 - Set ModelExportFormat = 0 (Intermediate)
 - Set ExportHiddenGeometry = true
 - Set ExportZoneWithObjects = true
 - Set ExportCharacterToSingleFolder = true
 - Set ExportEquipmentToSingleFolder = true
 - Set ExportSoundsToSingleFolder = true
 - Set CopyMusic = true
- Execute LaternExtractor.exe
 - Enter command "all", push enter
 
** Condition the EQ objects **
Use EQWOWConverter
- Run command "Condition Exported EQ Data"
 
** Converting EQ texture assets into BLP **
Use BLPNG Converter
- To BLP > Choose Folder  (select the conditioned assets folder)

** Clean up png files **
Use EQWOWConverter
- TODO

** Converting Everquest Map Assets (as obj) into World of Warcraft 3.3.5 assets (wmo) **
Use EQWOWConverter
- Run command "Convert zones to WMO"

** Update related DBC files
1) AreaTable.dbc
- Each map needs a record.  6000+ values
2) Each map needs a value.  

** Package everything up
Copy all of the output files from EQWOWConverter and the DBC changes into a MPQ and deploy


** Folder Structure **
Maps:
	wmo: World\wmo\Everquest\<zone>.wmo
	wdt: World\Maps\EQ_<zone>\<zone>.wdt
	wdl: World\Maps\EQ_<zone>\<zone>.wdl
	textures: World\Everquest\ZoneTextures\<zone>\<texture>.blp
Objects (contain M2 and textures):
	World\Everquest\PassiveDoodads\
	World\Everquest\ActiveDoodads\
	....
	
	
** Coordinate and Space **
- Everquest: X-Axis is S(neg) to N(pos), Y-Axis is E(neg) to W(pos)
- WoW: X-Axis is N(pos) to S(neg), Y-Axis is W(pos), to E(neg).  Z is up(pos) and down (neg)
- WoW maps are divided into 64x64 blocks (total of 4096) and each block is divided into 16x16 chunks.
- WoW map blocks are 533.33333 yards (1600 feet) w x height.  Coordinate origin is center, so +/- 17066.66656
- Each map chunk is 33.3333 yards (100 feet)
- In EQ, 1 unit of space is about 1 foot
- In WoW, 1 unit of space is about 1 meter (3.28 feet)
- Everquest maps to be broken up into 1000 x 1000 unit sub areas
