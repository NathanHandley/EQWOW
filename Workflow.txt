** Create the tele position
Example:
DELETE FROM game_tele WHERE id = 1492;
INSERT INTO `game_tele` (`id`, `position_x`, `position_y`, `position_z`, `orientation`, `map`, `name`) VALUES (1492, 10, 10, 10, 0.5, 725, 'EQArena');

Example:
DELETE FROM `instance_template` WHERE map = 725;
INSERT INTO `instance_template` (`map`, `parent`, `script`, `allowMount`) VALUES (725, 0, '', 0);

** Important **
Make sure the max file count inside the MPQ is set to something quite large (65536) preferrably
