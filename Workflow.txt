- Everquest Trilogy (note: COULD use Titanium, but would need to parse down list of assets)
- World of Warcraft WOTLK v3.3.5a (original, not classic re-release)

** TODO **
- Chunks use little-endian style byte order.  Make sure the chunk identifier is in the right order!
- Add source for LaternExtractor

- Updates to Map.dbc (hight map, might need for outdoor areas)
- Implement Collision (BSP?)
- Need alternate solution for animated textures on map files (perhaps move to M2?)
